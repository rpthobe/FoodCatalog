# FoodCatalog
Project: Linux Server of the Food Catalog
Author: Rosalie Thobe


IP Address: 34.201.6.151
Server name: ec2-34-201-6-151.compute-1.amazonaws.com 
	(that is what it told me when I used nslookup)

Software installed:
  I updated all of the packages by: sudo apt-get upgrade
  I also installed: python, Flask-SQLAlchemy, flask, pip, sqlalchemy, flask-seasurf,
upgraded oauth2client, virtualenv, apache2, postgresql

Description:
   Task was to set up our previous food catalog on a server.
  I used AWS Lightsail
to actually get the server.  This project was supposed to teach us how to
ssh onto the server with keys and with different permissions and users.
   Overall, this project was rather complicated.  Lots of little items that needed
to be done in order to actually complete the project.

Complications:
   I am having a issue with registering my ServerAlias.  I believe I saw that google
had to give access to the my certain server alias that may take up to weeks, so I 
am a little concerened that may not go through in time.  Therefore I'm not sure
if there is a way around this in the mean time.
